# WSO2-Linux-Troubleshooting-Assignment

## Resource Limitation ( Soft and Hard limits )

### 1. Creating a user with name : user1 : Execute the following

```
sudo adduser user1
```

### 2. Setting the user1 soft limit RAM size to 1 GB : Execute the following
###### Before running the below command switch to the newly created user by executing ```sudo su - user1```

```
ulimit -Sm 1048576
```

### 3. Setting the user1 soft limit file size to 2MB and Hard Limit file size to 3MB : Execute the following

```
ulimit -Sf 2048          
ulimit -Hf 3072  
```

### 4. Setting the user1 Linux open file limit Soft = 5000 hard = 6000 : Execute the following

```
ulimit -Sn 5000 
ulimit -Hn 6000
```

### 5. Setting the servers network cardâ€™s receiving ring buffer to Maximum value

###### Before executing anything below you need to find the network interface name that you need to set the ring buffer. To do so execute ```ifconfig``` and note down the name.

###### Then execute the following to find the maximum ring buffer values. ens33 is the nic name.

```
ethtool -g ens33
```

###### Then finally execute the following to set the max value. The max value on mine is 4096

```
ethtool -G ens33 rx 4096 
```

## SWAP

### Creating Two swap files with size of 100MB and 200MB

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=100M count=1
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap1 bs=200M count=1 
mkswap /swap
mkswap /swap1 
swapon /swap
swapon /swap1
```

### Assigning 200MB swap file a priority 10 and 100MB swap file a priority 20

```
swapoff /swap
swapon -p 20 /swap
swapoff /swap1
swapon -p 10 /swap1
```

### Configuring swap files to mount during a boot

###### In this step I went ahead and added these two lines to the end of the /etc/fstab file. Use ```sudo nano /etc/fstab``` to edit it.

```
/swapfile swap swap pri=20 20 20
/swapfile1 swap swap pri=10 10 10
```

### Changing the system swappiness value to 40

```
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=40
```

###### To make the swappiness persistent across reboots I went ahead and added the following to the /etc/sysctl.conf file.

```
vm.swappiness=40
```

## FTP

### Configuring and setting up the proftpd FTP server

###### Installing proftpd

```
sudo apt-get install -y proftpd
```
###### Configuring Server name. I went ahead and editted the ServerName field in the /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf file.

### Creating user proftpuser

###### Switch to root by typing ```sudo su -``` and execute the following :

```
sudo echo "/bin/false" >> /etc/shells
```

###### Then run the following to create the user and set the password :

```
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/false proftpuser
sudo passwd proftpuser
```
###### After running the above you can exit root by typing ```exit```

### Seting the proftpd process priority ( Nice value) as -5

```
renice -n -5 -p $(pgrep ^proftpd$)
```

### Assigning the I/O priority of Constant to the proftpd process

```
ionice -c 2 -n 0 proftpd
```

### Screenshots

## SQUID PROXY

### Seting up and configuring the Squid proxy server

###### Installing squid
```
sudo apt-get install squid
```

###### a. Allowing HTTP traffic via squid proxy

###### Go ahead and modify the /etc/squid/squid.conf file. Add the following before the ```http_access deny all``` line. After modifying execute ```sudo systemctl restart squid```

```
http_access allow all
```

###### b. Browser configuration can be done by accessing the proxy settings in the browser and enter the proxy server address as ```127.0.0.1``` and the port as ```3128```

###### c. Configuring Squid proxy to block Domains

###### First I went ahead created a file with the domains needed to be blocked in it. I went ahead and executed ```sudo nano /etc/squid/blocked-sites.acl``` and added the following to the file.

```
.facebook.com
.wso2.com
.ubuntu.com
```

###### Then I went ahead and modified /etc/squid/squid.conf file and added the following before the ```http_access allow all``` we added previously. After modifying execute ```sudo systemctl restart squid```

```
acl blocked-sites dstdomain "/etc/squid/blocked-sites.acl"
http_access deny all blocked-sites
```

###### d. Now we should Configure Squid proxy daemon so that it will start during the boot in only in 1,3,5 run levels

###### First I went ahead and removed all the symlinks from run levels 1,2,3,4 and 5. I did so by executing.

```
sudo rm /etc/rc1.d/K01squid
sudo rm /etc/rc2.d/S01squid
sudo rm /etc/rc3.d/S01squid
sudo rm /etc/rc4.d/S01squid
sudo rm /etc/rc5.d/S01squid
```
###### Then I went ahead and created symlinks for run levels 1,3 and 5 by executing the following

```
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/squid /etc/rc1.d/S01squid
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/squid /etc/rc3.d/S01squid
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/squid /etc/rc5.d/S01squid
```

###### Thats it now  squid will start during the boot in only in 1,3,5 run levels
